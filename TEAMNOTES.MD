# Team notes

## In-class 11/4:

- [Make a remixable post card for hax (#879)](https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/879)
**A hand drawn / computer sketch / XD / some annotation visually of what needs to be done or what pieces get broken out. This could be drawn on over top of a screen shot of the item or a photo of whiteboard sketches. Whatever make the most sense to you.**
